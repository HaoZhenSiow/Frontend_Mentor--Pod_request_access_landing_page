- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

This is my second practice project with ReactJS. In this project, I used useState() hook and conditional operator to show the error message when the email input is invalid or empty.
